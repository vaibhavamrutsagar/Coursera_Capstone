# # The Battle of the Neighborhoods 
# 
# ## 1. Introduction:
# 
# In this project we shall devise a solution in which we can identify the best neighborhood in Toronto, Canada for new businesses to start-up. 
# Through the development of this project, we can carefully identify a neighborhood best suited for new business start-ups to set up and function with minimal disurbances socially and economically. 
# 
# Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016 it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as a whole had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. The city covers an area of 630.20 square kilometres (243.32 sq mi) and comprises six districts – East York, Etobicoke, North York, Old Toronto, Scarborough and York – which, were amalgamated to form Toronto's present boundaries in 1998. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario.Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.

# ## 2. Business Problem
# 
# The stated business problem has mentioned previously is to devise a solution to find the best neighborhood in Toronto for new business start-ups to be set up and given Toronto to be a heavily populated capital with many businesses already present. There is a strong need to correctly filter out the best neighborhood for the new businesses to flourish and compete progressively with other competitors so as to create a more dynamic and competitive business culture and environment.
